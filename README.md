# Employee Turnover Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to this repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive project that focuses on analyzing and predicting employee turnover in a company. The project is divided into two phases: data analysis and machine learning model implementation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the HR Comma Sepcsv dataset, which can be accessed on Kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv).

## Data Analysis Phase

In the data analysis phase, the goal is to explore relevant questions that can indicate the possible causes of staff turnover. The following questions were answered during this phase:

- How many departments can be found in our dataset?

- What are the categories of our salary resource?

- Which department has the highest/lowest salaries?

- How many employees left the company by department?

- Who was promoted in the last 5 years and left the company?

- How many employees were promoted in the last 5 years?

- How were the projects executed by department, and who left the company?

- How does job satisfaction vary in relation to employee turnover rates?

## Machine Learning Model Implementation Phase

The second phase of the project focuses on implementing a machine learning model to classify and predict which employees are likely to leave the company. In this phase, a new round of EDA and data preparation is performed, but with a specific focus on the functioning of the model.

The dataset provided in the previous section will be used for training and testing the machine learning model. The code for implementing and training the machine learning model will be available in the "Model Implementation" folder of this repository.

## Project Visualizations

The most relevant visualizations generated during the data analysis phase are available in the "Project Views" folder of this project. These visualizations provide insights and help answer the questions explored in the project.
